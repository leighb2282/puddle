You can sign up for a (http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/ "Weather Underground developer key) (which is what I am using, more specifically the Cumulus Developer plan) which allows you to do 10 API pulls in 1 minute, their data is updated roughly every 10 - 15 minutes so this is not a big deal breaker (at least for me)
